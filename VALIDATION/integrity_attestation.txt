             UNIVERSAL HASH VALIDATOR CLI - INTEGRITY ATTESTATION
===============================================================================

Project: Universal Hash Validator CLI
Repository: https://github.com/AXI0MH1VE/Axiomhive-Leete
Attestation Date: October 3, 2025
Version: 1.0 (Initial Release)

===============================================================================
                              ATTESTATION STATEMENT
===============================================================================

I, the maintainer of this project, hereby attest that:

1. CODE INTEGRITY
   - All code has been written to the best of my ability
   - No malicious functionality has been intentionally introduced
   - All dependencies are limited to Python standard library
   - Code follows documented specifications

2. VERIFIABILITY
   - All file operations are read-only (no modifications to input files)
   - All hash calculations use standard Python hashlib module
   - All code is open source and publicly auditable
   - No network connections or external API calls are made

3. SECURITY PRACTICES
   - Input validation is performed on all user inputs
   - Error handling is explicit and informative
   - No sensitive data is stored or transmitted
   - Tool operates entirely offline

4. REPRODUCIBILITY
   - Given the same input file, the tool will always produce the same hash
   - Results are deterministic and platform-independent
   - No randomness or time-dependent factors affect output

===============================================================================

===============================================================================
                           VERIFICATION PROCEDURES
===============================================================================

To verify the integrity of this project:

1. MANUAL CODE REVIEW
   - Read through hash_validator.py (< 200 lines)
   - Verify no network operations
   - Verify no file write operations (except stdout)
   - Verify uses only Python standard library

2. AUTOMATED TESTING
   - Run: bash VALIDATION/ci/test_script.sh
   - All tests should pass
   - Review test output for anomalies

3. HASH VERIFICATION
   - Calculate hashes of all project files
   - Compare against published hashes (see repository releases)
   - Any discrepancy indicates potential tampering

4. COMMIT SIGNATURE VERIFICATION (if available)
   - Run: git log --show-signature
   - Verify commits are signed by trusted key
   - Check for commit signature chain of trust

===============================================================================
                              THREAT MODEL
===============================================================================

This tool is designed to resist the following threats:

1. SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS
   - Mitigation: No external dependencies beyond Python standard library
   - Mitigation: All code is publicly auditable
   - Mitigation: Tool can be run offline

2. FILE TAMPERING
   - Mitigation: Tool detects tampering through hash mismatches
   - Mitigation: Supports multiple hash algorithms (defense in depth)
   - Mitigation: Results are deterministic and reproducible

3. MALICIOUS CODE INJECTION
   - Mitigation: Tool performs no eval() or exec() operations
   - Mitigation: No dynamic code loading
   - Mitigation: Input validation on all user inputs

4. DATA EXFILTRATION
   - Mitigation: No network operations whatsoever
   - Mitigation: No logging to external services
   - Mitigation: All operations are local

===============================================================================
                           KNOWN LIMITATIONS
===============================================================================

1. This tool verifies file integrity but does not provide authentication
   - Hash matches indicate identical content, not trusted origin
   - Use GPG signatures or other authentication mechanisms for trust

2. This tool is not a substitute for malware scanning
   - Hashes verify integrity, not safety
   - A file can have correct hash but still contain malware

3. This tool relies on Python's hashlib implementation
   - If Python's hashlib is compromised, results may be unreliable
   - Consider using multiple independent tools for critical verification

4. This tool does not prevent TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) attacks
   - Hash is calculated at one point in time
   - File could be modified between verification and use
   - Use file permissions and access controls to prevent modifications

===============================================================================
                            REPORTING ISSUES
===============================================================================

If you discover any security issues or integrity concerns:

1. DO NOT disclose publicly until maintainer has been notified
2. Report via GitHub Issues or direct email to maintainer
3. Provide detailed description and steps to reproduce
4. Include any relevant logs or error messages

Security issues will be addressed with highest priority.
